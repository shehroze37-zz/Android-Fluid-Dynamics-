    <string name="about_information">\n|| Dysphagia is a term used to describe difficulty in swallowing. Roughly, 1 in every 17 people suffer from Dysphagia in differing severities and so too do 45% of over 75s.\n\n|| These problems are normally managed by texture Modification of the diet, including adding some sort of thickener to drinks.\n\n|| The reason for the creation of this app is to provide a virtual simualation of correctly thickened liquid. It was brought to our attention that current guidelines for thickening drinks are too vague.\n\n|| Feedback from patients and medical staff suggests an OPTIMAL thickness level should be identified and illustrated by means of virtual comparison.\n\n|| Using fluid dynamics and features of mobile devices it is now easy to compare the optimal level of thickness with a real sample.
